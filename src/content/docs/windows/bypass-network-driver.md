title: "Bypass Network Driver on OS Install"

On "Let's Connect you to the Network", press Shift + F10. Type the command:

```powershell
OOBE\BYPASSNRO
```

The system should reboot. When you reach that same network connection page, you should be able to select "I don't have internet", and continue through the setup. When you reach the desktop, move the drivers over from another device and install them.
