title: External Monitors for a Mac
---

When it comes to external displays, my mind would start to wonder on what could be the best to pair with my MacBook Pro. I never really cared for it back in Windows because since I am used to seeing pixels on my Windows Laptop (and this is after they implemented antialiasing starting in Windows 7) that I don't care for the features of an external monitor. As long as I have two, I thought.

But now that I started daily driving a Mac, I can't shake this thought that my laptop, idly sitting by on my side, produces this super clear, Retina display while my eyes stay on these monitors with low pixels-per-inch.

This link provides an idea on PPI and Pixel Density.

- [Mac external displays for designers and developers, part 2](https://bjango.com/articles/macexternaldisplays2/) - this one shows a table of external monitors and which PPI is considered retina.
- [What is Pixel Density and Pixels Per Inch (PPI)?](https://www.displayninja.com/what-is-pixel-density/) - but then I see this link where it says highest pixel density isn't always better and that it's all relative to the viewing distance.
