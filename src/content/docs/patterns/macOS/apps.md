title: Good Mac Apps
---

It's been almost three years since I started using a MacBook Pro as my daily driver for work and would like to share a number of apps I have been using.

- [**1Password**](http://1password.com) (Subscription, $5/month for Families Plan) - I have been using this since 2017 and I have not looked back since. Works great for my personal logins and quite handy for OTP and passkey authentication. The only subscription I am not ready to give up.
- [**Amphetamine**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704) (Free) - Keeps my Mac from sleeping. Helpful when I need to keep jobs running in the background while I step away for a bit. Can also set triggers for different tasks so it automatically gets enabled when certain events are, well, triggered.
- [**BatFi**](https://micropixels.software/apps/batfi) (One-time payment, $10) - Since I learned that Lithium batteries are best kept charged only up to 80% to prolong their life, this is a total game changer. Prevents my laptop from overcharging. I would love to have the same functionality on my iPhone 13 Pro, but sadly said feature is only available from iPhone 15 and up.
- [**Dato**](https://sindresorhus.com/dato) (One-time payment, $15) - Provides a quick way to view a small calendar on the menu bar and allows for setting up a number of timezones for quick reference. I set up multiple timezones and named them after my team mates so I know if Person X is already sleeping and should not be bothered anymore.
- [**Dropover**](https://dropoverapp.com/) (Free/One-time payment, $6) - Allows for a quick share (Airdrop or cloud upload) with a wiggle of a mouse. I am not actively sharing stuff with friends, but this is a neat way to do it when I need to.
- [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com) (Free) - A cool alternative to macOS Terminal. I have been using MobaXterm back when I was using Windows, and that software was the only one that holds me from considering macOS. But with this app, I switched to macOS and didn't look back.
