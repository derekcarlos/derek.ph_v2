title: "Useful Helper Scripts in Proxmox"
---

This is one of the best helper scripts I have come across as I am starting out learning about Proxmox. I heard that the original developer of said scripts have already passed, and yet the community was so strong they have decided to continue developing new scripts.

- [Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/)

These are my current LXC instances that I use which are hosted in my Proxmox node:

- Actual Budget - great help for budgeting
- Pi-Hole - DNS Server and Ad Blocker
- NGINX Proxy Manager - for setting up my reverse proxy to services
- Home Bridge - to allow our Panasonic Inverter Aircon to be controlled via HomeKit. At the moment it's the only use-case we have.
