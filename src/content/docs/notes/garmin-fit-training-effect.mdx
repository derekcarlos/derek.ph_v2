title: Import FIT Files to Garmin that Affects Training Effect/Status
---

The disadvantage of having a Garmin running watch and cycling without a Garmin head unit is that I don't get the Training Effect/Status (will be referred to in this post as TE/TS). I used to have this when I was still using Zwift, but I gave that up to save on costs.

I tried uploading the FIT file from my Wahoo headunit to Garmin Connect but it has no impact on TE/TS. Do I need to buy a Garmin head unit for this? Or rejoin Zwift?

Turns out I can still do this for free through the help of one user named [u/NerVnvs from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1bb6fup/imported_fitfiles_no_training_effecttraining/). Here's what I did:

1. Go to fitfiletools.com
2. Under *Device Changer*, click **Launch**
3. Under Step 1, upload the FIT file extracted from your head unit (in my case Wahoo)
4. Under Step 2, click the **Manufacturer** drop down and choose **Zwift**
5. Under Step 3, click **Go** and download the modified Fit File.

I uploaded this on my Garmin Connect account and there I see the TE/TS. It also updated my Cycling VO2Max stat which is great! No need to buy a Garmin head unit for now.
