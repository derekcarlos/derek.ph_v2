title: Predatory Governance?
description: The post explores the concept of "predatory governance," where leaders prioritize political survival over the welfare of their constituents, resulting in poor education, social service inequality, and dependence on patronage systems, linking these modern issues to similar strategies used during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines.

I was scrolling through social media when I saw a video from [@nikka.cg](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEjLR_YJpgT/) briefly describing the term called predatory governance where a nation's leaders intentionally chooses their political survival over the welfare of their constituents through their "poor decision-making skills".

Here are some of the points laid out in this video:

1. We are not given high quality education so we don't develop critical thinking and therefore we don't ask questions
2. Inequality in social services where people don't get enough resources in the government so because of this, they are just dependent on the aid being given through patronage.
3. The poorer the nation, the more predatory the governance is. In addition, those who are most predatory in a state are the members of political dynasties.

I have made a similar comment in the past where the politicians use this "ayuda" culture to seek patronage from the poor because they have a big part in the overall electorate who can vote them to win. After some reading, this goes way, way back than I thought.

## Quality of Education

The conquering Spaniards have used this same tactic hundreds of years ago to perpetuate the ignorance and weakness of the native.

During the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, educational opportunities for native Filipinos were limited, particularly in the early years of colonization. The Spanish authorities and the Catholic Church primarily focused on religious education aimed at converting the indigenous population to Christianity. This religious instruction was often conducted in local languages to facilitate conversion efforts.[^1]

Although the Spanish crown issued decrees, such as the Education Decree of 1863, which mandated the establishment of free public schools and the teaching of the Spanish language, these reforms were not fully implemented across the archipelago. Resistance from local clergy, who preferred using native languages to maintain their influence, and logistical challenges hindered the widespread dissemination of Spanish language and broader educational content.[^2]

## Social Services

There was a significant inequality of social services also during the Spanish colonial period as the colonial administration favors the Spanish elite and their local allies, while neglecting the broader native population. This neglect led many Filipinos to depend on patronage systems for access to resources and services.

The Spanish colonial government established a centralized system that concentrated power among Spanish officials and select local elites. This structure often resulted in the unequal distribution of resources, with the majority of the native population receiving minimal benefits. Social services, such as education and healthcare, were limited and primarily served the interests of the colonial rulers.

In this context, patronage became a crucial means for individuals to access resources and opportunities. The patron-client relationship was deeply ingrained in Filipino society, where local elites (principales) acted as intermediaries between the colonial authorities and the broader population. These elites provided aid and favors to their clients in exchange for loyalty and support, reinforcing social hierarchies and dependency.[^3]

## Conclusion

We have been freed from the Spaniards for more than a hundred year but their cultural impact is still felt in our consciousness. Yes, we are a free nation, but we are led by people who choose self-preservation more than their sworn duty to protect us. I am sure that if we keep on pushing them they will brand us as communists but that's not really the case here. Politicians have strong connections with businessmen (if they aren't one and the same which is the usually the case) which leads to conflicts of interests especially of the people.

I can't blame my countrymen who left the country for a better place. They already noticed that life in other country is so much better as compared to their native land. The thing is, the view of other countries on immigrants are already changing thanks to Trump, our world is slowly shrinking with no other places to go.
