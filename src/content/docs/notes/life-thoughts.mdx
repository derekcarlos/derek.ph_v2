Life in itself.

My mom would use to say that she's ready to pass on to the afterlife anytime as she's already too tired. I have been wondering why she thinks like that; why would anyone want their life to end when living is so much fun? I would even imagine having an immortal life, like in the movie The Age of Adaline where the titular character endured different lifetimes. I have soon come to realize that an neverending life is not fun as soon as you see people you know pass away.

And so while I stopped liking the idea of immortality, I still didn't quite understand why someone would be "tired" of life.

Then I started seeing a post in social media introducing the "Gen Beta", a new generation of kids born starting this year, 2025. Then they said, these Gen Beta kids will no longer know the life before Artificial Intelligence.

I belong to the generation of the Millenials, who along with Boomers and Gen X, have seen life before the Internet even became mainstream as it is today. In the old days as a kid I never fully enjoy the Holy Week because TV broadcasting is suspended and some networks only start broadcasting at 12 in the afternoon, especially from Maundy Thursday to Black Saturday. Then the shows would be different, you will not see your typical afternoon cartoon like Ceddie, or Remi. We can't play outside too or be loud or happy - because my mom would say God is suffering, you should not have fun. To endure the Holy Week is a fast from joy. This is no longer the case these days. Streaming services don't shut down during the Holy Week, so the entertainment continues!

I also remember being a student before the Internet, iPhones, MacBooks and productivity apps. Well at least from my elementary days, school libraries still prevail - but then again I was just having fun with no care about homework and studying. I honestly never tried borrowing a book in our school library because we were forbidden to come in unless we have an approval from our teacher. I don't know about the others, but books from school libraries are like jewels in a museum. I had an early taste of Internet and computers when I was in high school which inspired me to take up an IT course in college. But even back then in college, only few people walk around with laptops and since our family cannot afford one, I am happy to be using the trusty notebook and pen to jot down notes from our classes. If you don't pay attention, you'll miss out and you would resort to copying the notes from your classmates, assuming they took notes. This is no longer the case these days. One can record their professor teach the class and can still take down notes after the class.

I wonder if the Gen Betas of the world would one day say "in the old days, life is like this..."

If I could be a kid again, I don't know if I would want to be a kid back in my era, or in this era.

Back in my era, air is cleaner but my world is smaller because there's no Grab.

In this era, yes there's Grab and you can go anywhere, but smoke is almost everywhere, not healthy for an asthmatic like me.

Back in my era, there are no YouTube or Netflix, but I have friends to play and talk to.

In this era, Facebook and Instagram is here to connect with long lost friends, but family members are mostly stuck on their phones even when going out together.

I don't know whether to live again as a kid in this era or back in my era. And so I feel like there's no point or aspiration for me to be a kid again. I used to enjoy the holiday season because of the gifts and the joyful scent in the air with Christmas carols singing from house to house. Today some people doesn't even bother to put up decorations and shun kids when they start singing on their doorstep (that includes me).

So now I am starting to accept my fate, that my body would eventually be frail, and that my life in this world will eventually be forgotten as people move on with their lives going to one era to the next. Somehow dying isn't a terrible idea.

Is this how one feels when one no longer finds a purpose in their life? Like a life with no kids perhaps? Should I even bring forth a kid in these troubling times? I couldn't even choose if I liked being a kid in this era, what more for my own kid.

At this point, I don't know what to say. I want to live my life to the fullest, but I don't want to accept the fact that my life is already full and there's nothing else to do, but die.
