title: "How to Clean Monitors"
---

It turns out that cleaning monitors with alcohol can damage the coating. The only cleaning method we really need is distilled water.

Distilled water seems to be a really expensive way to clean especially if you're used to drinking tap water, but I guess I can buy a small bottle just for cleaning my monitors.

The next item you'll need is a micro fiber cloth.

To clean your monitor, dampen the cloth with distilled water and wrung the excess. Then wipe the monitor. Make sure to wipe the monitor with the clean section of the cloth to prevent spreading the dirt on the monitor.

I'll do that next time I need to clean my screen, especially on my MacBook Pro.
