title: "Server Setup"
---

I have decided to move back to self-hosting to lessen the expenses on subscription. Current subscriptions include:

* Apple One
  * iCloud Storage, Arcade, Music, TV+
  * Planning to remove Arcade and TV+ by the end of 2024 as this is economically viable to be removed as a group rather than individually
* Disney+
  * Unsubscribed in November 2024
* Netflix
  * Running for in-laws
  
## Current Hardware

* Main Storage Server
  * Synology DS923+
    * This replaced my aging Synology DS415play
    * Migrated my hard drives to the new machine on 11 October
* Main Server
  * Lenovo ThinkCentre M70q
    * This replaced my Lenovo X1 Carbon as my main Plex Media Server
    * This will also host my VMs for testing automation scripts
* Deco X50 Mesh Node
  * For networking between NAS and Server
  
## Future Acquisition Plans

* External Hard Drive for backup
  * I plan to acquire an external hard drive (at least 14TB) to serve as my backup drive for my Synology NAS. I plan to backup everything as I want to rebuild my Storage Pool to BTRFS and enable data scrubbing to prevent bit rot (data scrubbing job hasn't started since I got my new NAS)
  * Acquired November 2024
* Network switch
  * Current Deco X50 Mesh consumes 20W at idle. A network switch can consume as low as 6W so it's economical
  * Acquired November 2024
* Sound Bar
  * Planning to get the Sony HT-A3000 for its size
* RAM for Synology NAS
  * Not a priority at the moment
* SSD for Caching for Synology NAS
  * Not a priority at the moment
