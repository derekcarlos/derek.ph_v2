*This is a log book of what I am exploring and thinking about.* 

## January, 2025

This is my first post on this page, which aims to provide a thought log without requiring a proper post. I still don't know how often I would write here, but I am guessing one paragraph per week[^1]? I don't want to turn this into a blog, but it might come to that.

I am slowly getting back to the saddle after months of rest. Happy to see my resting heart rate going at 56-60 bpm[^2] even without taking the "as-needed" medication.

I bought a new table top for my standing desk which is deeper than what I already have. The one that I have right now is 140cm x 60cm in Maple Red color way. The new one I intend to replace my current table top is in White Oak, measuring to 140cm x 80cm. I don't have much space for a wider desk - although I need more depth so I can rest my arms while typing. I just need a good cable management solution which doesn't break the bank.

Speaking of bank-breaking opportunity, I just discovered TrainingPeaks Virtual which is going to surely compete with Zwift. I used to have TrainingPeaks Premium for my training plans and Zwift for the virtual ride component. I find it too costly to pay for both when I can just use my Wahoo head unit (it can be boring as heck, but it's cheaper) so I stopped my Zwift subscription. The good thing I see in TP Virtual so far is that it estimates the FTP based on the ride made (not sure if Zwift already does that). And since my training plans are already in TrainingPeaks, it's a straightforward integration. I hope they start importing to Garmin and Wahoo.

TP Virtual is going to be a free offering until March 2025. After that it will be part of TrainingPeaks Premium. Is it time to get Premium? Hmmm

I just tried doing a tempo ride today but I can only manage to finish one set. I can't remember the last time I managed to complete a tempo training ride. Maybe it's because I get bored real fast, which is why my mind is already conscious of the pain in my legs.

Updated this site to Astro 5. The typical upgrade via `npx` didn't work, so I tried the following command which worked perfect:

```
npm install @astrojs/starlight@0.30.3 astro@5.1.2 --legacy-peer-deps
```

It also helps reading the documentation on what files to change. Good thing that this site is versioned so if anything breaks on my local machine I could just rollback and try again.

[^1]: What a load of crap. I just posted so much and the week hasn't ended yet.
[^2]: I have been relying to this metric for years, although I also understand that this is not the "metric to rule them all"
